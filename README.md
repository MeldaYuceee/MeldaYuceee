👩‍💻 Melda Yüce – Crafting Ideas Into Reality

I’m a 2nd-year Computer Engineering student fascinated by how technology transforms ideas into tangible solutions. I merge AI, machine learning, web development, embedded systems, and IoT to build projects that solve real problems and spark curiosity.

🔬 Experiments in Innovation

Every project I take on is a learning experiment. I explore:

Intelligent Systems: From neural networks to NLP-powered chatbots, I create Python solutions that think, predict, and adapt.

Interactive Web Worlds: Designing websites that are not just functional, but intuitive, responsive, and engaging.

Embedded Intelligence: Arduino, sensors, LEDs – turning electronics into smart devices that interact with the real world.

Game Mechanics & Logic: Daily experimentation with game development to sharpen problem-solving and design thinking.

🛠 My Digital Lab

Python | C | C# | JavaScript | HTML5 | CSS3 | Arduino IDE | OpenCV | TensorFlow | Fritzing | NumPy | Pandas

🚀 Selected Creations (aka “Things I Made Come Alive”)

DroneFlightData: Real-time drone flight visualizer tracking altitude, speed, and distance – merging Python with data visualization for instant insights.

STM_News_Scraper: Automates collection of news and press releases from STM, streamlining intelligence gathering.

RedObjectTracker: Beginner-friendly real-time object detection using OpenCV – practicing vision algorithms with tangible results.

NeuroDigit: Handwritten digit recognition (MNIST) with ~97% accuracy – a compact yet precise ML demonstration.

Motion-Detection-Alarm: Real-time motion detection system that triggers alarms using OpenCV and Python, combining practical security and embedded logic. GitHub link

Certificates_And_Learning: A dashboard tracking my certifications and online achievements – proof of continuous learning.

💡 Philosophy in Code

I turn “what if?” into “what works.” Every challenge is an opportunity to experiment, iterate, and innovate. I aim to create projects that are useful, intriguing, and technically elegant.
